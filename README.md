# User-Registration
User Login and Registration using Verification Code
Here, I used Identity to Authenticate the user. Used .Net Core MVC, this can be used as a Web API too.
Here, I didn't use email as because I don't have a SMTP server
No DB stored procedure were written. Created a Identity Database which gets auto created using Identity.
